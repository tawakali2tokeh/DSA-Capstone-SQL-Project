# DSA-Capstone-SQL-Project

# Kultra Mega Store Inventory Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the KMS sales data to identify the most valuable customers, the most valuable products, customer segment and evaluate the effectiveness of the company's shipping expenditure.

## Data Source
I obtained the data from the DSA LMS platform. It contains KMS transaction records from 2009 to 2012. It contains information on sales, profit, shipping costs, shipping modes, customer IDs, and order details.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft SQL Server. [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads?msockid=3495a62c6de9650c173fb3da6c7764d6)

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation:**  
I created a database named `KMS` to serve as the foundation for all my data operations.

- **Schema Design:**  
 I created a schema named `Db` with `Database Owner` privileges to organize database objects.

- **Data Import and Table Preparation:**  
  I imported two datasets into the database, and named them `KMS_Inventory` and `Returned_Orders`, respectively.
  - **`Db.KMS_Inventory` Table:**  
    Contains columns such as `Order_Row`, `Order_ID`, `Order_Date`, `Order_Priority`, `Order_Quantity`, `Sales`, `Discount`, `Ship_Mode`, `Profit`, `Unit_Price`, `Shipping_Cost`, `Customer_Name`, `Province`, `Region`, `Customer_Segment`, `Product_Sub_Category`, `Product_Name`, `Product_Container`, `Product_Base_Margin`, `Ship_Date`. 
  - **`Db.Returned_Orders` Table:**  
    Contains `Order_ID` and `Status` columns, representing order return statuses.

- **Table Joining and View Creation:**  
I joined the `Db.KMS_Inventory` and `Db.Returned_Orders` tables on `Order_ID` to enable comprehensive analysis of order details and return statuses, and I created a view named `Db.KMS_VIEW` to facilitate this.

```sql
CREATE VIEW Db.KMS_VIEW
AS
SELECT Db.KMS_Inventory.Order_ID,
Db.KMS_Inventory.Sales,
 Db.KMS_Inventory.Customer_Name,
Db.KMS_Inventory.Customer_Segment,
Db.Returned_Order.[Status]
FROM Db.KMS_Inventory
FULL OUTER JOIN Db.Returned_Order
ON Db.Returned_Order.Order_ID = Db.KMS_Inventory.Order_ID
```

## 2. Data Analysis 

### Data Cleaning
- I Converted data types for certain columns to ensure proper data handling. For example, I transformed Customer ID from SMALLINT to INT to allow the column to accommodate larger  data.
### Data Transformation Aggregation
- I used aggregate functions such as `SUM()` to get total sales and shipping costs.
- I aggregated data to identify top customers and products based on sales amount.
### Filtering
- I used `WHERE` clauses to focus on specific customer segments, such as "Small Business," to derive targeted insights.
### SQL Commands and Clauses
- I utilized `SELECT` command to specify data retrieval.
- I used `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` to organize my result output.

*4. Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 customers*

```SQL
SELECT TOP 10 Customer_Name,

SUM (Shipping_Cost) AS Total_Shipping_Cost, 
SUM(Discount) AS Total_Discount, 
COUNT(Order_ID) AS Total_Order
FROM Db.KMS_Inventory
GROUP BY Customer_Name
ORDER BY Lowest_Customer_Sales ASC
```
![table4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b14be765-aa31-4eac-bae7-5bc3bf3efdfb)

Answer:
- Customer Engagement and Feedback: The company should hold one-on-one sessions with customers to understand why they aren't patronizing the business as much and the company should also get product reviews and ratings from customers to identify areas for improvement.
- Order Management and Timeliness: The company should prioritize its own order processing and delivery, placing the same importance on timely orders as customers do and ensuring that orders are delivered on time for customer's satisfaction   
- Customer Service: Providing good customer service is a significant plus and can help retain customers and encourage repeat business.

*11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and
express air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company
appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer*

```SQL
SELECT Ship_Mode, Order_Priority,
SUM(Shipping_Cost) AS Total_Shipping_Cost,
AVG(Shipping_Cost) AS Average_Shipping_Cost
FROM Db.KMS_Inventory
WHERE Ship_Mode IN ('Express Air', 'Delivery Truck')
GROUP BY Order_Priority, Ship_Mode
ORDER BY Order_Priority, Ship_Mode
```
![t11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84a8bede-755a-4eab-8550-d477ae3ea1c1)

*Answer:*
- No, Since Express air is the fastest and most expensive shipping option, it should be reserved for transporting critical and high-priority orders. Trucks, which are more affordable, should be used for transporting low, medium, and unspecified orders.
