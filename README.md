## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation:**  
I created a database named `KMS` to serve as the foundation for all my data operations.

- **Schema Design:**  
 I created a schema named `Db` with `Database Owner` privileges to organize database objects.

- **Data Import and Table Preparation:**  
  I imported two datasets into the database, and named them `KMS_Inventory` and `Returned_Orders`, respectively, and performed necessary data cleaning to ensure data quality and consistency.

  - **`Db.KMS_Inventory` Table:**  
    Contains columns such as `Order_Row`, `Order_ID`, `Order_Date`, `Order_Priority`, `Order_Quantity`, `Sales`, `Discount`, `Ship_Mode`, `Profit`, `Unit_Price`, `Shipping_Cost`, `Customer_Name`, `Province`, `Region`, `Customer_Segment`, `Product_Sub_Category`, `Product_Name`, `Product_Container`, `Product_Base_Margin`, `Ship_Date`. I adjusted the column data types to ensure data integrity and compatibility.
  
  - **`Db.Returned_Orders` Table:**  
    Contains `Order_ID` and `Status` columns, representing order return statuses.

- **Table Joining and View Creation:**  
I joined the `Db.KMS_Inventory` and `Db.Returned_Orders` tables on `Order_ID` to enable comprehensive analysis of order details and return statuses, and I created a view named `Db.KMS_VIEW` to facilitate this.

```sql
CREATE VIEW Db.KMS_VIEW
AS
SELECT Db.KMS_Inventory.ORDER_ID,
Db.KMS_Inventory.Sales,
 Db.KMS_Inventory.Customer_Name,
Db.KMS_Inventory.Customer_Segment,
Db.Returned_Order.[Status]
FROM Db.KMS_Inventory
FULL OUTER JOIN Db.Returned_Order
ON Db.Returned_Order.Order_ID = Db.KMS_Inventory.Order_ID
```

order by Small_Business_Highest_Sales DESC
```

*8. Which Corporate Customer placed the most number of orders in 2009 â€“ 2012*

```SQL
SELECT TOP 1 Customer_Name, Customer_Segment, 
COUNT (Order_ID) as Most_Order
FROM Db.KMS_Inventory
WHERE Customer_Segment = 'Corporate'
AND Order_Date >= '2009-01-01' and Order_date <= '2012-12-31'
GROUP by Customer_Name, Customer_Segment
ORDER BY Most_Order DESC
```

*9. Which consumer customer was the most profitable one?*

```SQL
SELECT TOP 1 Customer_Name, Customer_Segment, 
SUM(Profit) AS Consumer_Customer_Most_Profitable
FROM Db.KMS_Inventory

ORDER BY Consumer_Customer_Most_Profitable DESC
````

*10. Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to?*

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT Customer_Name, Customer_Segment, [STATUS]
FROM Db.KMS_VIEW
WHERE [STATUS] = 'Returned'
```

*11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and
express air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company
appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer*

```SQL
SELECT Ship_Mode, Order_Priority,
SUM(Shipping_Cost) AS Total_Shipping_Cost,
AVG(Shipping_Cost) AS Average_Shipping_Cost
FROM Db.KMS_Inventory
WHERE Ship_Mode IN ('Express Air', 'Delivery Truck')
GROUP BY Order_Priority, Ship_Mode
ORDER BY Order_Priority, Ship_Mode
```
